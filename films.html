The only other time that not-so-lofty figure was reached was in 2011.</p><p>Last year, dozens of women - including acting stars Cate Blanchett, Kristen Stewart and Salma Hayek - staged a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44095914" class="story-body__link">red-carpet demonstration</a> against gender-based discrimination in the industry. As Blanchett remarked: "The prestigious Palme d'Or has been bestowed upon 71 male directors... but only two female directors."</p><p>You do the maths.</p><p>For the first time Cannes claims to have "methodically counted the female directors submitting their films for selection" and the jury for the big one is made up of four men and four women; including movie star Elle Fanning.</p><p>Festival president Pierre Lescure honoured the late French filmmaker and "icon of the festival" Agnès Varda, by featuring her on the <a href="https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/infos-communiques/communique/articles/the-official-poster-of-the-72nd-cannes-international-film-festival" class="story-body__link-external">official poster</a>.</p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption body-width lead">

        </figure><p>Ken Loach is on a Palme d'Or hat-trick as he returns to Cannes this year with the other British-backed film, Sorry We Missed You - written by Paul Laverty.</p><p>The 82-year-old UK director has bagged the big one twice before, first in 2006 for the Irish War of Independence drama, The Wind That Shakes the Barley. Ten years later he won again for I, Daniel Blake, which tackled unemployment and food banks in England.</p><p>That film sparked a national debate and Loach will be hoping for more of the same with his latest politicised effort, which follows a delivery driver and his carer wife, who are pushed to breaking point as they struggle to keep their family going on zero-hour contracts.</p><p>One of Loach's veteran US counterparts, Terrence Malick, 75, returns this year too with his historical drama, A Hidden Life, which tells the story of Franz Jägerstätter, a conscientious objector from Austria, who refuses to fight for the Nazis in World War Two. </p><p>Malick took the Palme d'Or in 2011 for The Tree of Life; an experimental movie which found Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain pondering the origins of existence and the very meaning of life itself (we've all done that on a rainy Wednesday in work).</p><p>Cannes loves nothing more than a good 'auteur' and so along with Malick and Loach, Pedro Almodóvar's new film about a director in decline, Pain and Glory - starring Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz - also makes the esteemed list.</p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption body-width lead">

Taron Egerton, who plays the piano, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47674223" class="story-body__link">recently told the BBC</a> that his portrayal will show him at his best and worst.</p><p>"Elton essentially gave me licence to go and make him look ugly at times," he said.</p><p>The pair performed together at an Oscars viewing party in February, and with the Rocket Man expected in town there are whispers of another possible pre-screening performance.</p><div class="social-embed"><div class="social-embed-post social-embed-youtube">
